The Hostel Management Portal is a web-based application designed to efficiently manage various aspects of hostel operations. The system allows both hostel management staff and residents to interact with important data related to room allocation, maintenance requests, fee tracking, and more. By integrating a structured database, this project aims to streamline the management of hostel-related tasks, ensuring smooth operations and better user experience.

Features
Room Allocation: Assign rooms to new residents, track room availability, and manage room assignments.
Maintenance Requests: Allows residents to submit and track maintenance requests for hostel-related issues.
Fee Tracking: Tracks payments, pending fees, and generates reports for hostel management.
User Roles: Two main user roles—Hostel Management and Residents—with different levels of access and functionality.
Data Management: Stores and manages data related to students, rooms, payments, and maintenance requests.

Impact
The system enabled efficient management of room assignments, maintenance requests, and payment tracking.
Hostel management staff could easily handle large datasets, while residents had a simple interface for their daily tasks.

Technologies Used
Frontend: tkinter
Database: MySQL
SQL Queries: Used for database management, normalization, and data retrieval
Tools: MySQL Workbench (for database design)
Database Design
The system is built with a well-structured relational database to handle and manage large datasets efficiently. Key features of the database include:

Normalization: Ensures data integrity by reducing redundancy and organizing data into multiple related tables.
Relational Design: The system uses primary and foreign keys to create relationships between tables (students, rooms, payments, etc.).
Efficient Queries: SQL queries are optimized to quickly retrieve and manipulate data.
